### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a bunch of projects, checkout my recent commits!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about distributed systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything open source!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really, but I can probably help you with GNU/Linux, Go or TypeScript.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <https://matejamaric.com/contact/>
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be super into software minimalism and I had a functional setup that used only 48MB of RAM!
If you are wondering how I managed to do that, I was using OpenBSD with DWM and I turned off every daemon that I didn't use.
I even wrote a shell script for mounting USB drives, so I didn't have to use any auto-mounters.

I have a [blog](https://matejamaric.com/blog/) on which I sometimes post useful articles.
