### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about purely functional programming.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything open source! Preferably using some functional programming language or Go.
- 💬 Ask me about anything really, but I can probably help you with GNU/Linux, Go or TypeScript.
- 📫 How to reach me: <https://matejamaric.com/contact/>
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be super into software minimalism and I had a functional graphical setup that used only 48MB of RAM!
If you are wondering how I managed to do that, I was using OpenBSD with DWM and I turned off every daemon that I didn't use.
I even wrote a shell script for mounting USB drives, so I didn't have to use any auto-mounters.
- 🌍 I have a [blog](https://matejamaric.com/blog/) that contains some useful articles.
