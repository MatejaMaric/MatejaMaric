### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a bunch of projects, checkout my recent commits!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Express.js
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything open source!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with fixing a bug in my [software renderer](https://github.com/MatejaMaric/erender/issues/1).
- 💬 Ask me about anything really, but I can probably help you with GNU/Linux, Laravel or C++.
- 📫 How to reach me: <https://matejamaric.com/contact/>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be super into software minimalism and I had a functional setup that used only 48MB of RAM!
If you are wondering how I managed to do that, I was using OpenBSD with DWM and I turned off every daemon that I didn't use.
I even wrote a shell script for mounting USB drives, so I didn't have to use any auto-mounters.

I have a [blog](https://matejamaric.com/blog/) on which I sometimes post useful articles.
